This is a simple application to demonstrate the use
of the MyLocationOverlay used in maps to show the
users current position. This application should be used with 
an Android device that has Google Maps as this application
uses the Google Maps to show the users current location, this
will be shown by the use of a Blue Dot on the Map. This application will also
animate to the current location of the user and zoom into their
proximity.
